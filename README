This is a Unix port of mk, originally done for the Inferno operating system.
It contains parts from plan9port, inferno and the latest plan9 source tree.

See NOTICE, LICENSE and/or README files in each directory.

This fork aims to be 100% compatible with plan9 mk, while adding some small
improvements and a simpler bootstrap/build process.
